Hi everyone!

Mini project 1 is due in 1.5 weeks, so it's a good time to start thinking about it. [The complete instructions are accessible here](/assignment/01-mini-project.qmd), **along with starter code** that should help you clean and prepare the data, and the rubric I'll use to grade the project.

I'm giving you a big dataset with 100,000+ rows in it. Your job is to tell some sort of story with it using **one plot**. You'll likely want to summarize it somehow (similar to what you've done with essential pandemic construction and words in *The Lord of the Rings* in past exercises).

If you need help, please reach out on Slack! Do not suffer in silence!

Good luck!
